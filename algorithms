First shot
ALGORITHM
-For looping around to try to create all the combos

PROBLEM
- Didn't solve problem.

Recursion #1

ALGORITHM
- First attempt that copy and pasted examples from online.

PROBLEM
- Didn't solve problem.


Recursion #2

ALGORITHM
- Create all the colours combos(ie. 2 marbles = "blue, green, blue+green"

PROBLEM
- Way way way to many combinations.
- 4 marbles was looking at millions of combinations.
- ULTRA SLOW.


Recursion #3 -- Current

ALGORITHM
- Create a string of the marbles (ie. 2 marbles = "01")
- Generate all the permutations for the string.
- Reduce the string length and generate all the permutations.
- Remove any duplicates.
- Convert the strings to colours
- Now go through all the combinations and remove any reverse colour marble combinations
- Print

PROBLEM
- 7 marbles is minutes
- 8 marbles is hours :(


Recursion #4

- Create Marble objects instead of a string combo?
- Is there any way to not generate duplicates?
- Or not generate reverse colour marble combinations?
- Where is the current version the slowest?
