Consider a marble machine that produces sequences of marbles. This machine takes as input, one parameter, an integer from 1 to 8 which determines the set of colours available for making a marble sequence. 

Your task is to write a Java program that outputs all of the possible marble sequences that this machine could possibly generate. Please return to us:
- the source code
- a chosen input and the output your program produced.

Input:

Your program must read an input selection from the command line from 1 to 8.. The colours available to the machine for each input selection are as follows:

1 = [blue]
2 = [blue, green]
3 = [blue, green, red]
4 = [blue, green, red, yellow]
5 = [blue, green, red, yellow, orange]
6 = [blue, green, red, yellow, orange, purple]
7 = [blue, green, red, yellow, orange, purple, brown]
8 = [blue, green, red, yellow, orange, purple, brown, white]

Constraints:

1. The machine is allowed to use any colour only once per sequence, or not at all.
2. A marble can be made of either one or two colours.
3. The machine must generate at least one marble per sequence.

Output:
 
Your program should generate the list of all possible marble sequences that could be generated for the given input selection from 1 to 8.

Each sequence must be output one per line. A marble made of a single colour is represented by the name of the colour and a marble made of two colours is represented by the names of each colour seperated by '+'. Each marble must be seperated by a single space.

Sample Input:

2

Sample Output:

blue

green

blue+green

blue green

green blue
